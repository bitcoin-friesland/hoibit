# CRM-BTC Project Coding Rules

## ID Handling Policy

- **All IDs (primary keys, foreign keys, record IDs, etc.) must always be handled and stored as integers.**
- Never store or use IDs as floats (e.g., 1.0) or strings (e.g., "1") in code or database operations.
- Always use `parseInt`, `Math.trunc`, or an equivalent method to ensure IDs are integers before inserting into the database, using in queries, or writing to logs (such as audit_log).
- This rule applies to all code paths, including API handlers, audit logging, and any data serialization/deserialization.
- This policy prevents issues with type mismatches and ensures consistent, reliable ID handling throughout the CRM-BTC project.

### Example

```js
// Correct:
const id = parseInt(result.id, 10);
await db.insert({ record_id: id });

// Incorrect:
await db.insert({ record_id: result.id }); // if result.id could be a float or string
```

### Rationale

Consistent integer handling for IDs avoids bugs, ensures compatibility with database schemas, and prevents audit or reference errors.
