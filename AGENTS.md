# Working in hoibit

## Read first

1. [Contributor and agent starting point](docs/AGENT-START.md): repository purpose, real commands, task-specific sources and safety boundaries.
2. [README](README.md) and the linked domain guides. Existing project-specific instructions and the user's current task scope still apply.
3. Current PR discussion, head/base commits and changed-file scope before editing.

## Collaboration

- Work on a focused branch; isolate your checkout when other contributors are active. Preserve unrelated changes. Do not stage, stash, reset or publish another contributor's work as your own.
- Agree on one writer for overlapping files; record dependencies and integration order. Stop editing if the branch unexpectedly changes.
- Assign implementation, review and integration responsibilities explicitly. Any supported agent may provide context or perform assigned work; an agent name is not evidence or release authority.
- Keep instructions portable in repository Markdown. Do not copy project-specific rules into global agent configuration or edit authentication settings.
- Use the [handoff template](docs/HANDOFF-TEMPLATE.md). Link exact source/evidence, state what passed, failed or was not run, and give the next concrete step.

## Safety and verification

This public source repository is not permission to expose CRM records or send Telegram messages. No real automated test suite is configured. Validate authorization, duplicate events, external failures and redacted logging with local mocks before a release.

- Use only commands that exist in the applicable package or guide. Review lifecycle hooks and remote targets before running them.
- Keep secrets, credentials and personal/customer records out of docs, fixtures, issues and logs. Use synthetic data and mock/sandbox integrations.
- Generated output, schema, dependency, hosting and production changes require their own scope and verification. Do not make them as incidental cleanup.
- Pin claims to the tested commit and environment. Dated logs, review verdicts and green builds do not establish current runtime safety.
- Do not merge, deploy, migrate, send real messages or change provider settings without the required owner authorization. A docs-only merge can still trigger deployment automation.
